# PURPOSE: 
> Develop a fully functional application by utilizing basic knowledge, tools and techniques acquired in prior INFO classes. Gain first-hand knowledge on  how to implement a complete project from scratch that will result in a better understanding of the inner workings of web applications. The aim is to be comfortable building projects by implementing common techniques such as directory structures, URL routers and utilizing MVC patterns.

# SCOPE:

## Planning and design:
> - Learn how to leverage MVC pattern and designing program execution flow.
## Application Features:
> - Explore Web working principles with a focus on HTTP, DNS resolution flow.
>
> - Explore Websockets and understand how to allow browsers to have full-duplex communications       within servers.
>
> - Get a deeper understanding of routing and how to map URLs to processing logic.
>
>  - Understand  vulnerabilities and what precautions to take in order to prevent attacks.
>
## Logic Functionality:
> - Practice designing generic controllers, and how to handle requests and return responses after    inheriting from an object handler.
## Auxiliary Functionality:
> - Better understand common functionality such as log processing, information configuration etc.

# EXPECTED OUTCOME:
> At the end of the schedule it is expected that there will be a working application in place that meets the following criteria: A web API server. a fully functional client interface and  appropriate database usage

# EVALUATION/ASSESSMENT METHOD:
> Once a week, there will be scheduled  in-person hourly meeting. During this meeting, I will have to showcase or explain the progress of the project. To narrow down the scope of the meeting, I have itemized what will be reviewed and/or assessed.  Any feedback and/or suggestions will be incorporated into the next week. 
# RESOURCES:
> This project is designed to expand hands on experience beyond what was taught  in prior classes. There will be overlapping reference to material still  available via Canvas. In addition, the internet will be a valuable resource to get knowledge. I chose the following links because they either are guides/tutorials from the software or platforms I may be using or because in my prior experience the authors have been able to explain subject matters in simplified terms and as such I am able to apply the principles to my own projects.
